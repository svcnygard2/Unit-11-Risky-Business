# Unit-11-Risky-Business
Peer-to-peer lending services such as LendingClub or Prosper allow investors to loan other people money without the use of a bank. However, investors always want to mitigate risk.
- I will build and evaluate several machine-learning models to predict credit risk using free data from LendingClub.
- I will use the imbalanced-learn and Scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using the resampling and ensemble learning techniques.
## Libraries Needed:
- numpy
- pandas
- pathlib
- collections
- sklearn.metrics
- sklearn.preprocessing
- sklearn.model_selection
- sklearn.linear_model
- imblearn.over_sampling
- imblearn.metrics
- imblearn.ensemble
## Tips:
- Remember to restart kernel incase of "bugs".
- Give the code time to run - if there is an asterisks(*) by the algorithm, just let it run.
